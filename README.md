The microarray data was analysed to find differentially phosphorylated sites between treatments, and to observe the difference in significant phosphorylation changes between all treatments. 

This analysis was perfomed using Google Colab, and has been archived here. The analysis can be performed locally by adjusting file paths (particulary those using `local_dir`).
